<div class="text">Beauty of Birds</div>
<p>The dazzling variety of birds that can be seen on safari adds a whole new level of appreciation for Africa’s wildlife. At Rhino River Lodge we are lucky to have some of the most beautiful and rare species of birds in southern Africa. The colours of some species alone are enough to take your breath away.</p>

  <div class="text">Beauty of Nature</div>
  <p>I declare this world is so beautiful that I can hardly believe it exists.” The beauty of nature can have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it results in disbelief in its very existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or amazement.</p>

  <div class="text">Beauty of Ocean</div>
  <p>I close my eyes and relish in the beauty of this moment. The air is plush with the tangy scent of the monstrosity before me. My skin is speckled with cold mist. It is jumping out at me, crawling down my skin, and leaving saline trails in its wake. I feel small. Tiny. Minuscule. I am nothing in this moment, but I feel everything. It roars at me and attacks the land on which I stand.</p>

  <div class="text">Sun Shine</div>
  <p>Early mornings and their sunrise are quite special. You have to learn to appreciate them. You often forget what it’s like to wake up early and just sit back and enjoy the moment of a fresh start of the day. You try to stay in bed as long as possible, because you don’t want to get out in the cold. When you finally manage to get out of bed, you’re too busy preparing yourself to get ready for work. When you don’t have to work, you tend to sleep in until the day has almost passed halfway.</p>

  <div class="text">Water Falls</div>
  <p>A waterfall is a river or other body of water's steep fall over a rocky ledge into a plunge pool below. Waterfalls are also called cascades. The process of erosion, the wearing away of earth, plays an important part in the formation of waterfalls. Waterfalls themselves also contribute to erosion.</p>
